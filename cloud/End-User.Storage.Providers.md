## End-User (Popular), Free Storage Providers

For storing data on services such as DropBox/OneCloud, see cryfs, dolphin, rclone, sparkleshare,

Coming soon ... I have a spreadsheet I need to convert to a markdown friendly format; or perhaps I'll just upload the ods directly to this repository.  It's incomplete, but useful.
```

### rclone

`rclone` connects with both popular / end-user style storage services and developer oriented storage services, providing a mount on POSIX systems.
