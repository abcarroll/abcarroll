1) Use !{command} - it executes the last invocation of said command.  For example :
```
vim /some/long/path
cd
!vim
```

2) !! For executing last command 

3) our `fuck` and `please` commands. (reexecute last cmd with sudo) 
for executing the previous instance of command quickly

4) ditch grep. Use perl pie/pe 

5) proper xargs, for x in y usage

6) learn c
