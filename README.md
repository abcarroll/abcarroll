Hello there, I'm A.B.  I've been writing PHP for almost 15 years, and programming even longer.  I write a large variety 
of other languages from time to time, such as Javascript and the C language -- and of course PHP.

If I'm not doing those things I can usually be found trying to learn about or improve various open source operating 
systems, such as Debian Linux, other types of Linux, and the big three BSDs: OpenBSD, NetBSD, and FreeBSD -- all three 
of which I have a soft spot for.

These are various notes I've collected throughout the ages to help share interesting and useful tidbits about software
development and systems management (aka. server administration, or operations), theoretical and real-world.   I do these
things to pay my bills, so it's a big deal to me. 

All notes were written by me unless otherwise noted, or you go to an external site of course.  I have a large collection
of notes and as of August of 2019, and I will try to get them all sorted through, cleaned up, and committed to this git 
repository before the end of the year.  

Additionally, I have even more generic libraries and small projects that are in various stages of development, from 
only a rough concept all the way through a small few that are totally complete, but have never seen the open-source 
light of day, and were never used in various commercial projects.  Similarly, I will begin releasing them as soon as I 
am able to time-wise.

choose to do so, or is noted otherwise.  Any examples that I did not personally write, I have attempted to credit the 
original author(s) where due.

## Markdown Cheat Sheet

Since this repository is written in markdown, markdown related things go first, here:

 - [adam-p/markdown-here wiki cheatsheet] is a pretty good markup cheat sheet.
 - [highlight.js languages repository] is how to find out which languages are called what using the syntax highlighting.
 For example, you need to use `sql` not `mysql`, but interestingly there is a `pgsql`, too.  Just remove ".js" from the 
 names in the directory.
 
## PHP and related:

 - [A.B's PHP Cookbook](PHP.Cookbook.md)
 - [A.B's Guide to PHP Testing](PHP.Testing.md)
 
## TODO

 - A lot.  
 - To come:
   - Quick Reference of Protocols & File Formats (Information and resources on various file formats and protocols (usually network ones).)
   - 'Enterprise' Software Development (When I write software it usually has to scale out.  This is dedicated to that, particularly with PHP and the operations techniques behind it.) 
   - Debian Linux (I use Debian linux primarily as my personal desktop as well as my first choice for server operating systems.  However, that's not always the best choice.  More about that... SSO, Forking...)
   - Other Big Collections of Notes (These are collections of links and resources I've legitimately found useful, but that I did not create or write myself.)
   - CI / CD, Automation (Deployment, Jenkins, Drone, Gitea, and so much more...)
