Hello there, I'm A.B.  I've been writing PHP for almost 15 years, and programming even longer.  I write a large variety 
of other languages from time to time, such as Javascript and the C language.

These are various notes I've collected throughout the ages to help remind myself of interesting and useful tidbits about
software development and systems management (aka. server administration, or operations), theoretical and real-world 
commercial software development.   I do these things to pay my bills, so it's a **big** deal to me.

I am releasing them to the public little by little after cleaning much of it up.  I will attempt to finish this by the
end of 2019. 

## Markdown Cheat Sheet

Since this repository is written in markdown, markdown related things go first, here:

 - [adam-p/markdown-here wiki cheatsheet] is a pretty good markup cheat sheet.
 - [highlight.js languages repository] is how to find out which languages are called what using the syntax highlighting.
 For example, you need to use `sql` not `mysql`, but interestingly there is a `pgsql`, too.  Just remove ".js" from the 
 names in the directory.

## General Software Development

 - [Licensing Works: An Overview](Licensing.Works.Overview.md)

## PHP and related

 - [A.B's PHP Cookbook](PHP.Cookbook.md)
 - [A.B's Guide to PHP Testing](PHP.Testing.md)

 
## TODO

 - A lot.  
 - To come:
   - Quick Reference of Protocols & File Formats (Information and resources on various file formats and protocols (usually network ones).)
   - 'Enterprise' Software Development (When I write software it usually has to scale out.  This is dedicated to that, particularly with PHP and the operations techniques behind it.) 
   - Debian Linux (I use Debian linux primarily as my personal desktop as well as my first choice for server operating systems.  However, that's not always the best choice.  More about that... SSO, Forking...)
   - Other Big Collections of Notes (These are collections of links and resources I've legitimately found useful, but that I did not create or write myself.)
   - CI / CD, Automation (Deployment, Jenkins, Drone, Gitea, and so much more...)
   - Clean up a lot of other PHP+C notes.
   - AWS/ELK stuff.
   - Twig and friends
   - Write some scripts to keep this repo clean and tidy.
