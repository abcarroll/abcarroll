# PHP: Misc

These are things that probably should go in the cookbook, but are too old, too small, are too uninteresting to me to
clutter it up.  In other words: This is the hoarder inside of me not wanting to throw these things out.

- statsd (I've replaced most use of statsd with Kibana)

## pressuretest-php

Project of mine from PHP 5.3 days.  Would be neat to see how well this runs on modern php7.2+.

## regular expressions

This is less php specific:

 - [Awesome Regex](https://github.com/aloisdg/awesome-regex) is a list of regular expression resources.
 - [regex101](https://regex101.com) is a damn fine cross-language regular expression tester and official "pastebin" of
 freenode regex channel.
