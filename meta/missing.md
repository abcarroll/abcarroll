# When files go missing...

This is a repository of notes I have personally collected over the years.  As such, many of them may refer to files
that don't actually exist in the repo yet.  Either I changed the filename, or if you're seeing this particularly it
means I have not completed "readying" it for public release as many were meant as a personal, my-eyes-only reference
sheet.

If you could, just let me know what you're interested in by contacting me, and maybe I can hurry it up.

See [META.md](META.md) for my contact details.
