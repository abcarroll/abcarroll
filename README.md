# AB's Notes

Hello there, I'm A.B.  I've been writing PHP for almost 20 years, and programming even longer.  I also write a large variety of other languages from time to time, such as Javascript and the C language. 

If I'm not doing those things I can usually be found trying to learn about or improve various open source operating systems, such as Debian Linux, other types of Linux, and the big three BSDs: OpenBSD, NetBSD, and FreeBSD -- all three of which I have a soft spot for.

These are some various notes I've began collecting to help share interesting and useful parts and paradigms regarding both "real-life" and theoretical software development, and operations management.  I do these things to pay my bills, so it's a big deal to me.

All of these are written by me unless otherwise noted.  I have a large colelction of notes and as of August of 2019, I will try to get them all sorted through, cleaned up, and committed to this git repository before the end of the year.

# Quick Reference of Protocols & File Formats

Information and resources on various file formats and protocols (usually network ones).

# 'Enterprise' Software Development

When I write software it usually has to scale out.  This is dedicated to that, particularly with PHP and the operations techniques behind it.

# Debian Linux 

I use Debian linux primarily as my personal desktop as well as my first choice for server operating systems.  However, that's not always the best choice.  More about that...

# Other Big Collections of Notes

These are collections of links and resources I've legitimately found useful, but that I did not create or write myself.

# CI / CD, Automation
