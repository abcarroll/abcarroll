## PHP / FFI Foreign Function Interface

### External Resources

 - [ffi.c at original repository] to see how FFI works.  it's just a big C-language parser for a very specific dialect 
 (subset) of the C language (which is why it is so slow).
 - [scorninpc/php-ffi-tests] is a simple ffi test library for GTK but good place to start.
