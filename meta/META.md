## About / Contact

All notes were written by me unless otherwise noted, or you go to an external site of course.  I have a large collection
of notes and as of August of 2019, and I will try to get them all sorted through, cleaned up, and committed to this git 
repository before the end of the year.  

Please additionally note that all code examples here are public domain and require no attribution, unless you personally
choose to do so, or is noted otherwise.  Any examples that I did not personally write, I have attempted to credit the 
original author(s) where due.

If you wish to contact me, you may do so by sending an e-mail to the output of the following base64 encoded string:
