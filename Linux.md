1) Use !{command} - it executes the last invocation of said command.  For example :
```
vim /some/long/path
cd
!vim
```

2) !! For executing last command 

3) our `fuck` and `please` commands. (reexecute last cmd with sudo) 
for executing the previous instance of command quickly

4) ditch grep. Use perl pie/pe 

5) proper xargs, for x in y usage

6) learn c 

7) learn how to use find. 

8) text manipulation is probably the most tedious things in a shell.  For example to get a hash from sha256sum, if you pass a file it'll show up as "ddax99d -" with the trailing bit.
