# Language and VM Design

This is a small set of resources for language and VM design.

## Tutorial Languages

### Bril

Bril is a small intermediate representation (IR) for learning.  Most excitingly, it is attached to a Cornell University CS class which has the course material and more available online.

### LLVM

##### Stacker

There is a project, Stacker, which used to be included as an example of LLVM usage in very early versions.  Unfortunately, it is no longer included, assumingly due to the fact it has not been manintained in a very long time.  However, it is still quite useful, both as an interesting example as to how to write a "stack machine" in itself, as well as the code and tutorial included.

The last available documentation is in version 2.3.  The last commit with the stacker available in the source is commit #.....

## Lambda Calculus and Turing Machines

### Iota and Jot

Iota and jot can be described as the simplest language.  It is an unambiguous, turing-complete language which just two symbols:
